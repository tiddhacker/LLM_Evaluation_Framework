      | Can lambdas return a value ?              | Yes, lambdas can return a value. The type of the return value will be inferred by the compiler. The return statement is not required if the lambda body is just a one-liner                                                   | Lambdas may return a value.

This process, known as interpretation, allows for immediate execution without the need for explicit compilation into machine code before running. |
